# About

## Short version

I try to earn $1000 per month trading options. ðŸ’°


## Long version
This blog records my attempt to make $1000 (USD) profit per month by trading stock options.  

The $1000 needs to be cash, so trades that are still open do not count. I will share all my option trades on this blog.  

There will also be posts about trading strategies, and other things I learn along the way.  

Follow along, and let's (hopefully) make some money together.

### My stock trading history
Complete amateur.  

Before trying to trade options, I mainly just bought and held stocks/ETFs as investments.  USED to have a $100k+ trading account thanks to a few lucky picks (e.g. bought Tesla in 2017), and the overall market just going up (pre 2022).  

Got bored during COVID pandemic and started trying to trade options.  Made around $15k the first year mainly selling naked puts.  Thought I was a genius!

Proceeded to lose well over $50k cash during the market downturn in 2022.  I realized that I was not a genius.  In fact, I had no idea what I was doing! 

So, I decided to start this blog to record my attempt to actually learn how consistently make money trading options.

### Starting point 
As I start this blog (March 2023), my trading account has a net worth of around $30k (USD).

### Strategies
For now, I will be mainly using Bear Call Spreads, and Bull Put Spreads.  They seem like the safest strategy to start with.
