Well, I f*cked up...again.

Should've been a really great week, but my refusal to take a small loss on McDonald's a couple months ago came back to bite me in the ass.

I got assigned on the short leg of a bull credit spread, so now my account is like -30k in cash.  I will probably need to close all my `MCD` positions next week for total loss of $2-3k (i.e. all my accumulated profits so far).

Sigh.

Also, started experimenting a lot, and overtrading a bit.

Here's my new positions on the week:

Assignment at the beginning of the week put me in panic mode.  Completely forgot to make my weekly `SPY` trade, which would have been in the profit already.

Made a few trades based on <a href="https://optionalpha.com/">Option Alpha</a> "trade ideas".  Will be experimenting with their trades over the next month.

Randomly decided to trade an iron condor on futures `ES` (S&P futures).  Might consider trading futures more, because they're all cash-settled (i.e. no assignment risk)

`VIX` is a long term hedge in case the market tanks.

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $334.95

After getting assigned $27,500 position on `MCD`, my account had zero margin left to do anything.  

So, I panicked and closed basically all of my shorter term positions.  Fortunately, all the positions were either around break-even or in the profit.

Unfortunately, I would have made a lot more if I just held a couple more days as the market jumped up.

## Notes and Lessons

Profitable week which will soften the blow a bit when I take a huge loss over the next week or two.

Still weighing my options on what to do with my shit `MCD` positions right now.  If I had just followed the original strategy, I would have let it close for a loss of a few hundred dollars.  Now, thanks to my genius, I'm sitting on a $2k loss.

### McDilemma
Here is the situation:
- Currently have 100 shares of `MCD` at average price of around $272.50 per share.  
- Have 1 long put at $260 (other half of my original short put spread)
- Have another `MCD` short put spread at 270/250 expiring Jun 21, which will lose me over $1000 if I close it now. Tried to roll it, but failed.
- Current `MCD` share price is $256, and not looking good.
- Options are all expiring in 2 weeks (Jun 21st)

Here are my choices right now:

1. Close everything; eat the loss

- Just close all the positions I have for a total loss of $2000 to $3000.  Trying to roll/adjust everything just made it worse last time.

2. Keep the 100 shares, and close everything else

- I still think McDonald's is a strong company, and it is quite undervalued at the current price level.  I could keep the shares (and debt) and continue selling covered calls on it, *hoping* that it will go up.  
- The problem with this is that I will be paying interest on my negative cash balance until I sell. Also, it will kill my margin.  Also, the stock could tank farther, then I'm just really fucked.

3. Try to roll everything out 
- Delay my doom, and try to roll everything out farther and hope that `MCD` stock price recovers.  I tried to do this last week actually, but couldn't get my orders to fill.  I might need to roll it for 0 credit.
- Also rolling out the 260 long put will cost me money, unless I also roll it down to 255-250, which will then increase my risk
- This strategy fucked me last time.

So what should I do?  Not sure.  Nothing seems optimal.
