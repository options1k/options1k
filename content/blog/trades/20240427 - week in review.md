Market bounced back up this past week.

Made a little bit back from the huge loss last week.  

But, also made me think that I shouldn't have cut my loss last week.  No, cutting the loss was the correct decision.  Stick to the rules.  I should've just cut it earlier, so I wouldn't have loss so much.

Few new positions this week:

Weekly `SPY` trade, monthly `PG` trade.  The premium on `PG` was super low, not sure if should have bothered with it or not.

Added `COST` to my monthly long-term trading strategy (same as `PG`).  This is the first month I'm trading it.

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $181.54

Few small wins.  Not enough to flip this month into positive after last week though.

## Notes and Lessons

The big loss from last week still stings.  Should've just cut it earlier.

Market rebounded this week, so managed to close a few small positions.

Seems like I can only make money when the market is bullish.  That's not good.  I need to make money when its going both ways.

I guess my strategies are all mainly bullish though, so maybe need to think about more ways to balance things out.
