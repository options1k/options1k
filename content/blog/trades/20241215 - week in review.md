Was a pretty slow week.

Market was down a little bit, but pretty flat.

Lost a tiny bit of money.

Here are my trades from the past week:

</div>

Variety of trades -- covered calls, short puts, put/call spreads, dividend capture.

Kind of regret playing `SCHD`.  It only has monthly options, so is a slow play.  My call on it expires next week, but if it drops below $28, then I'm maybe going to be holding it for another month, which I don't really want to do.  I guess I could just sell it.

## Closed / Expired:

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: -$34.76

Small loss.  Another Option Alpha "trade idea" on `SPY` loss money.  May think of abandoning the strategy soon.

`PFE` seems super undervalued based on fundamentals, so have started selling naked puts on it.  It has been in a terrible downtrend though, so there is a bit of a risk.  If it can't generate some new profitable drug, then it could go to $0 I guess?

## 0DTE Trades

Didn't get a lot of 0DTE positions in this week.  The automation software couldn't find trades according to my parameters.  There is very little volatility right now, so premiums are hard to come by?  May need to expand my parameters a bit.

## Notes, Lessons and Thoughts

Slow week, with a small loss.

Been thinking about going long on some individual stocks. I pretty much completely missed the AI boom over the past couple years, so have that urge to chase it a bit.

All the AI-related stocks are up crazy now -- `NVDA`, `PLTR`, etc.

Is it too late?  Or is this just the beginning?  Which companies will survive, and which will die out?

Maybe I should look at another industry, instead of chasing it.

If I were to take a long position, I think I would use a deep in-the-money covered call instead of buying shares outright.  Mainly, I don't have enough money to buy 100 shares of NVDA or something else.

Should I chase it, or just keep trying to trade option income strategies and not give in to FOMO?

Hmmmmmmmm.
