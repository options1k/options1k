Another losing week.

Market continued downward, though there was a glimpse of hope at the  end as it bounced off major support level.

Will it hold?  Who knows.

I realized I do really poorly in bear markets.  My mind is still stuck in that long-term investor mindset. I think the market will always go up, so it's really hard to take a bearish position even when it looks obvious on the chart.

## Opened

Some stupid trading this week.  Opened a `TXN` bull position, then cut my losses quickly when it looked like it fell under support.  
Then, it bounced the next day, so I regretted closing my position, and got back in.  ðŸ˜…

- SPY
- TXN (x2)
- CRM
- CSCO (covered call)

## Closed / Expired:
Cut losses a bit late on `SPY` position.  I was hoping and praying again instead of being an emotionless killer.

## Notes and Lessons

My losing weeks are a lot bigger than my winning weeks, which is not good.

I would rather have a few big winning weeks, and many small losing weeks.

Getting better at cutting losses, although still not as ruthless as I need to be.  

Biggest lost of last week was `SPY`, which should have actually been cut the week before.  I didn't want to feel the pain of realizing the loss.

Pain procastination.

Generally everything is down this week.  If market keeps tanking, I'm going to be in a huge hole with my `MSFT` strategy.  So, let's hope it calms down a bit.
