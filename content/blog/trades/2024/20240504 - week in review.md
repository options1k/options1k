Up and down we go. 

Market turned down to start the week.  Thought I would need to eat some more losses.  Then, it finished with a big spike up to basically close where it started. ðŸ˜‚

Took a few new positions this week:

Weekly `SPY` trade, and a couple of bullish positions.  

I'm still trading with a bullish bias.  Have been looking for some more bearish positions to take, but there were not many good looking opportunities.

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $223.92

`BX` closed one day after taking the position.  Why can't all trades be so easy? ðŸ™ƒ

## Notes and Lessons

Didn't realize `NVO` had earnings during the week.  It was actually in profit for awhile, then dropped after poor earnings.  

If I was paying attention, I should've closed it earlier for small profit instead of taking a loss.  Wasted opportunity.  After I realized my mistake, I cut it right away, which I guess is a good thing.

So, now I've added a column on my portfolio to show me next upcoming earnings.  Maybe that'll help me keep track of things.

Overall, still an OK week for me.
