Another ho-hum week for me.  

I did not realize it was going to be a shortened week for American Thanksgiving.

Market finished super strong, breaking new highs and continuing its ridiculous bull run (that I have failed to capture a lot of ðŸ¥²)

Here are the trades from last week:

## Opened:

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $50.26

Couple trade ideas closed for profit.  

Some covered calls expired, but I am not counting the position as closed until the original assigned shares are also sold.

## 0DTE Trades

Started testing out an auto-trading software for 0DTE called [Trade Automation Toolbox](https://tradeautomationtoolbox.com/).  

It is very cool, but only works on Windows, so it was a bit of a pain to setup (since I'm on Mac).  Had to buy a Windows Cloud PC account.  That's about it actually, so I guess it wasn't that difficult. I hate having to sign up for accounts.

Took profits early on trades again.  Didn't work out this week, as I ended up with a small loss.

## Notes and Lessons

ANOTHER very, very tiny profit this week.  ðŸ˜‚

Nice to finish the month on a positive -- even if it is a very tiny positive.

November ended up being a decent month for me, will do a recap later this week.

I am enjoying the slow and steady feeling of covered calls and dividend plays.  I guess everything works in a bull market though.  

I'll see how I feel when one of the stocks I bought 100 shares in crashes ðŸ˜…

Next week, plan to do more of the same.  

For 0DTE, I will start testing out letting positions go to expiry instead of taking profits early.  In backtests, the numbers always work out better, but we'll see how it goes in real life.  

Think I will also try entering some more monthly `SPY` positions.  Not sure yet if I will do regular put spreads, or some sort of iron condor type trade.
