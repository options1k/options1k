Took my first weekly loss in a long time (~2.5 months).

Thanks Apple.  

Maybe should've held on longer, but decided to stick to my rules and cut it off.

Here are the trades for the past week:

Trying another bear call spread with `EOG`.  Looks like it's going to end up in a loss again though. ðŸ˜…

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: -$46.78

Big fat loss on `AAPL`.  It had two big gap down days in a row.

Tried to close it after the first gap down, but order didn't fill because it had an even bigger gap down the next day.

Bleh. Ended up taking a bigger loss than I wanted to.

Maybe should've held longer, because it looks like it is bouncing off support.  Oh well.

## Notes and Lessons

Slowish week.  The one loss on `AAPL` ruined what otherwise would've been a decent profit.

I stuck to my rules though, so I am happy about that.

Market continues to trend up overall.  Maybe should forget about looking for bearish positions for now; they don't seem to be working very well.  My `EOG` bear call spread looks like it will turn into a loss next week.
