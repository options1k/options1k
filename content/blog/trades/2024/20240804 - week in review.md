I've realized a couple of things:

I am really bad at cutting losses, and managing risk.

Those are the two things I believe that are stopping me from being consistently profitable.

I tend to lose all my profits and more on one or two bad trades. 

Typically, it is because I failed to cut losses on time, OR the position simply jumped way too fast before I could do anything. 

So, I have decided to adjust my position sizing on everything...

First, here are the trades for the past week:

Whole bunch of trades from Option Alpha "trade ideas".  Still on the fence of whether this strategy will work o not.

Reduced size of weekly `SPY` trade, as mentioned above.  Naked put on `CSCO` again.

Another losing week. Damn.

At least it wasn't a big loss.

## Notes and Lessons

Market has suddenly become very volatile and bearish.  Good for selling options, but also bad if you already have a bunch of bullish positions (like I do).

I am going to start adjusting my strategies this month.

Maybe, will also abandon some that are not doing so well.

### Risk control / position size
First, I am going to reduce maximum risk for every trade to around 1% of portfolio size.  

My portfolio has been stuck at $30k+ for a really long time (it should be $40k+ right now, but I kept fucking up).  That means my MAX risk per trade should only be around $300 (i.e. 1% of $30,000).  

For <a href="/long-term-trend-strategy/">long term trend strategy</a>, I will set risk to around 3% since I only make one trade per month on those.

I am still mainly just selling spreads, so I will simply make the risk equivalent to the width of the spread.  

For example, if I'm selling a bull put spread, then the spread can only be around $4 (e.g. sell 100 put, buy 96 put).  Depending on the premium received, my max risk will be $300+ (i.e. 100 - 96 - premium).

By reducing the width of the spread, I also do not need to constantly monitor my positions to cut losses when things spiral out of control.  I just let it die.

Before, I was selling much wider spreads like $5-$10.  I thought that I could simply cut my losses when it hit my max loss, but I was never able to do it because I was mentally weak, or the price just spiked up/down too quickly.

### Strategy review
I am also reviewing my strategies.

My most profitable strategies so far have been <a href="/spy-10day-strategy/">weekly `SPY`</a>, and <a href="/90dte-msft-strategy/">`MSFT` strategy</a>.

This is mainly because the market was in a great bull run for the past 6-7 months.  Not sure how they will perform in a bear market.

My <a href="/long-term-trend-strategy/">long term trend strategy</a> has not done so well; mainly because of a couple big losses I took on `MCD` trades (it actually recovered after I ate the loss, FML).   If I don't include `MCD`, it has been mildly profitable so far.

I have removed `MCD` from the trade list because I realized it doesn't have enough option volume, and bid-ask spread is too big.

My original <a href="/gin-lim-strategy/">stochastic/trend/support strategy</a> has been quite unprofitable so far.  This is due to not being able to cut my losses on time, which results in some HUGE losses.

I will give it one more chance using my new position sizing.
