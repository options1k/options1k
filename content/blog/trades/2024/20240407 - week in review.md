Market had a volatile week.

Down, and up, and back down again.  Finished a little bit down.

Came close to having to cut some positions for a loss, but ended up not doing anything haha.

Just a couple new positions this week:

## Opened

<div class="trade-table weekly full-width">

|**Ticker**|**Action**|**Type**|**Date**|**Expiry**|**Sell Strike**|**Buy Strike**|**Premium**|**Qty**|**Fee**|**Net**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|SPY|open|BPS|2024-04-02|2024-04-12|510|500|1.03|2|2.8|203.2|
|SPY|open|BPS|2024-04-03|2024-04-12|509|499|0.6|2|2.8|117.2|
|BIDU|open|BCS|2024-04-05|2024-05-17|120|125|0.85|2|1.11|168.89|

</div>
The market opened the week with a big gap down.

As a result, I entered my weekly `SPY` position at the wrong delta (i.e. 0.25 instead of 0.15), because I had already placed the order before the market opened.  

Luckily, I ended up closing it the next day for a small profit, then reopening it again at the correct delta.  By then, the market was up a bit, so I ended up at a pricepoint that was only $1 less than original (i.e. 509 vs 510)

Lots of work for nothing ðŸ˜…

Just `SPY`.

## Notes and Lessons

Market is at its most volatile level in the past few months. 

Took a bearish position in `BIDU` to hedge all my bullish positions.  `BIDU` has been trending down slowly for the past 9 months, so just going with the trend.

### MCD conundrum
I noticed one of my open April 275/265 bull put spread in `MCD` is probably going to close for a loss later this month.

This position was taken as part of my <a href="long-term-trend-strategy/">long term strategy</a>.  In my backtest, it never once lost money on the 15/10 delta bull put spread over the past 5 years.  Unfortuantely, it seems like it's going to break that streak.

Shows you how reliable backtests are.

I'm thinking if I should just take the loss, or roll it out to a later data.

I can roll it out at the same strike prices, but receive no premium.  Or, I can roll it out and increase the spread width at the same time to like 275/255 or something.  I would receive small premium, but also be doubling the risk.

Not sure what the smarter option is.  I think I will probably roll it, because I dont feel like eating the loss right now.  In long term, I think `MCD` will still continue uptrending, unless something else catostrophic happens.

Will this decision come back to bite me in the ass?  Possibly.
