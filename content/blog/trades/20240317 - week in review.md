Small profit this week.

Market opened super strong to start the week, then really poor to end it.  Starting to get a bit choppy these last couple weeks.

Maybe we're seeing the end of this uptrend? Or, maybe not?

Only opened a couple new positions this week:

## Opened

<div class="trade-table weekly full-width">

|**Ticker**|**Action**|**Type**|**Date**|**Expiry**|**Sell Strike**|**Buy Strike**|**Premium**|**Qty**|**Fee**|**Net**|

|SPY|open|BPS|2024-03-12|2024-03-22|500|487|0.56|2|1.8|110.2|

</div>

Nothing very interesting.  Weekly `SPY` trade, and position on `BRK B`, which I only opened 1 spread on by accident again (instead of 2).

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $150.49

Took my loss on `EOG` bearish position.  It broke out of it's downtrend pretty explosively, so good thing I took my loss when I did.

Big profit on weekly `SPY` trade, which paid a much higher premium that usual.

My `CSCO` naked put from a <a href="/trades-2024-02-26/">couple weeks ago</a> also expired out of the money, but I'm not going to count it as a close trade.  I'm going to consider part of the open position I still have on CSCO.


## Notes and Lessons

This month has not been super profitable for me so far.  Have taken two losses the past couple weeks, after not taking a loss for like two months.

Market is technically still in an uptrend, but has been a bit choppy recently.  Maybe it will start going into a range, or start heading down.

Who knows?  I certainly don't.

I think I will still look for more bullish trades.  I haven't "won" a bearish trade for a long time.

Let's see if I can finish the second half of the month off strong.
