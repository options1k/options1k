Not much happening this past week.  

Opened a bunch of new positions, the most I've had in awhile:


## Opened

Accidentally entered my order wrong for monthly `PG` position.  Not sure what I did exactly, but I opened, then immediately closed the position. Ended up costing me $7. Reopened it again.

Also opened my first bearish position in a long time with `ENPH`.  The last few bearish positions I took ended up in losses, so we'll see how this goes.

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $28.72

Nothing much happening with closed trades this week.  

I regret closing my `SPY` trade early last week.  If I just held, and stuck to the plan, would've made an extra $160+ or so this week.

The fear of losing profits got the better of me.  Damn!

## Notes and Lessons

Another up an down week for the overall market. 

Things started down, then gapped up big time to finish the week on an extremely positive note.

I still have mainly bullish positions (just one bearish).  Going to keep sticking with mostly bullish trades until the trend ends.

Getting a bit bored though, which is making me enter more trades.  Perhaps need to look for some other strategies to mess around with.

I have one open position on `CSCO` resulting from an assigned naked put long ago, which is down $700 or so dollars.  Thinking how I should deal with it.  Add to it?  Get out for a loss?
