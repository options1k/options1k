Took a huge loss this week.

Market tanked, and I only had bullish positions opened.  Ended up cutting a few positions at 200% loss or higher.

Bleh. Bleehhhhhhhhhh. 

Also, didn't really take any new positions, because my account had no liquidity:

## Opened

|**Ticker**|**Action**|**Type**|**Date**|**Expiry**|**Sell Strike**|**Buy Strike**|**Premium**|**Qty**|**Fee**|**Net**|

</div>

Just the weekly `SPY` trade.  Also, only opened quantity of 1, because no liquidity in account.

## Notes and Lessons

How to lose $1000 in a week.  That should be name of this blog. 

Three losses, zero wins.   

Each loss, I closed a bit too late.  Was sitting there, watching/hoping/praying that they would recover.  In the back of my mind, I knew I should have cut them earlier, but then thinking ... "oh, just wait another day. What's the worse than can happen".

Well, they could all drop more!

Hesistation and undisciplined trading cost me a few extra hundred dollars.  I did finally cut them all, so that's a positive I guess?

That's 3 down weeks in a row.  Let's see what next week brings.
