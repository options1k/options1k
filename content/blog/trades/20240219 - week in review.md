The market gapped down big last week, then immediately went back up the next day.

This ended up working out well in my favor, as my pre-market order filled with a much better than expected premium.

Overall, another nice profitable week.  More details below:

I unintentionally turned a `MSFT` 375/360 bull put spread into a 375/330 spread.

Also, opened two seperate positions on `SPY`.  The first position I took received a much higher than expected premium because the market gapped down on open.  I decided to close it early, to lock in the profits after a couple days.

Then, I kind of regretted closing it early, so took another small position, for quite a lousy premium.  Maybe shouldn't have done that.  A bit undisciplined trading on my part.

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $476.73

One of my best weeks ever, profit wise.  Looking at it now though, I shouldn't have closed the `SPY` trade early.  Even though percentage wise (i.e. annualized return), it sort of makes sense to close it early (1500% vs 500% annualized return), I think it would have been better to just let it run to expiry.

## Notes and Lessons
<div class = "trade-table monthly full-width">
{% image "img/sp500-feb19.png", "S&P500 Feb 19 2024" %}
</div>
The SP500 is hanging around all time highs at around the 5000 mark.  

There was a quick sell off earlier in the week, but then it bounced right back, and is holding above the 20EMA really well.

The gap down scared me a little bit, and I was looking for some bearish positions to take.  I'm getting a bit nervous with all my bullish positions, but it has worked out so far.  The market is basically on a 3-month bull run right now.

Just keep sticking to the plan!
