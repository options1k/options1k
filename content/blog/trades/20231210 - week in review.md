Took a loss this week.

First one in awhile.  

Seems like my self-sabotage from <a href="/trades-2023-11-27/">last week</a> was successful.

Still have a few more losing positions in my account, so next week's outlook isn't looking to positive either.

Market held strong this week. Took a couple more bullish positions.  `NVO` is a bit sketchy looking, but we'll see how it goes.

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $-54.26

Took my loss on `ENPH` as it closed over my cut loss line, and seemed to be breaking its bearish trend.  Seems like I made the wrong decision though, as it's since turned back downwards.  Perhaps I should have held on longer.

My initial entry was not very good to begin with.  I should've had a bit more patience to wait for retrace back to resistance more.


## Notes and Lessons

I'm beginning to think that I really did subsconsiously sabotage myself with a few positions.  

For some reason, I took them even though I knew in the back of my mind they were not that great.  I had been on a pretty good winning streak for the last few weeks, so maybe I felt a bit guilty that I was winning too much? Or, that I was just getting lucky (not skill), and didn't deserve the wins?

Maybe I took bad positions to see if my luck would continue.  Or, maybe I somehow decided that it was time that I finally lose a trade, so I made it happen.

That's what's going through my head right now.
