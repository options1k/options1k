After a terrible last month, this month is off to a decent start.

The market continues upwards, which is nice, but has also put all my open bearish/neutral trades in the red.

Here are the new positions from last week:

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $336.30

Closed my weekly `SPY` position early again.  It reached 80% of its max profit in just a few days, so didn't want to risk holding it another week just to make 20%.  

Wondering if it is the right decision or not in the long term?  Am I leaving money on the table?  My original strategy is just to let it run to expiry, but I also did not backtest to see if it is better to take profits at 80% or not.

## Notes and Lessons

Market continues to be crazy hot.  How much longer can it go like this?  New highs every day basically.

I have been taking a whole bunch of bearish positions recently, and they are all basically sitting at losses right now.

The last decent pullback was in April.  

Should I forget about trying to have a balanced portfolio (ie. bullish + bearish positions)?  Or, should I just go all in on the bull trend and make as much money as I can while it's hot?

Something to think about.
