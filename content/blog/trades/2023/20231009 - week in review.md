Market held / bounced pretty hard off support this week, which helped prevent me from taking some more losses.

Sudden war in Israel just broke out over the weekend, so market may panic collapse again next week.

Who knows.  

## Opened

Opened bunch of bullish positions this week looking for bounce off support.

- SPY
- QQQ
- IWM
- SBUX
- MPC

## Closed / Expired:
Nothing, except my weekly `SPY` position expiring.  Was too scared to try to "add to winner" again this week after my big loss last time.  We'll see next week.

## Notes and Lessons

Currently have a few positions that are sitting in profitable positions.
   
Wondering if I should try to take/salvage some early profits as it seems like the general stock market will tank next week due to conflict in Middle East.  

Why do people have to start wars man.
