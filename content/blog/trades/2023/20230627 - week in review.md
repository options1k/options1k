I went away for a short trip last week, and my phone broke, so I couldn't login to my account or do anything.

One of my GTC orders filled though (for a small loss / breakeven):

**Closed:**
- IBM

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $-2.8

## Notes and Lessons

I had the GTC order set on IBM at the same price that I entered at.  IBM had spiked a couple weeks ago with all the other tech/AI stuff.  I was just trying to get out without any losses. 

The price started coming back down last week.  In hindsight, I could have set the GTC price a bit lower to take a tiny profit.

Main lesson this week though -- bring a backup phone with you.
