The market continued upwards this week.

Making it a bit difficult to find good entries for my basic strategy as everything is "overbought" in an uptrend.

Here's my trades for the week:


## Opened

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|SHEL|open|BPS|2023-11-13|2023-01-19|62.5|57.5|0.75|1|0.58|74.42|

|MSFT|open|BPS|2023-11-17|2023-02-16|330|300|2.56|1|2.09|253.91|

</div>

`MSFT` broke its all time high, and just keeps pumping along with the market.  I opened two more positions according to my <a href="/90dte-msft-strategy/">MSFT strategy</a>.

`SHEL` has been in pretty strong uptrend, so took a bullish position off a retrace.  

I opened 1 qty by mistake again though, instead of the usual 2.  I seem to do this often; need to be a bit more careful with my orders.

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $159.66

A few closed positions for small, but decent profit.  

Should've had bigger position in `MCD`, which is part of my <a href="https://options1k.com/long-term-trend-strategy/">long term trend strategy</a>.  I noticed in some months (i.e. February), it has very little option volume, which makes it not viable for trading.   I wonder why this is?


## Notes and Lessons

Another winning week.  Seven weeks in a row now?

Getting a bit nervous, as I feel like I'm due for a loss ðŸ˜…

The market just keeps going up.  It had a huge pop up again last week.  Maybe due for a slight retrace?

Or, are we going to breaking all time highs this year?

Who knows.  I sure don't.
