I made some decent profits this week for the first time in awhile.

The market popped up and I had mainly bullish positions, so things worked out. 

I'm not going to get too excited though, as I'm still deep in the hole overall.

Have been reading a lot about trading psychology recently; so trying to control my emotions.  

Stay in equilibrium.

## Opened:
Only one new position this week, which is part of my <a href="https://options1k.com/spy-10day-strategy/">weekly SPY strategy</a>.
Tried to enter a couple others, but orders didn't get filled.

## Closed / Expired:
Closed 5 positions (2 expired).

Closed `CRM` a bit too quickly.  It had earnings in a few days, so wanted to get out of the position beforehand.  If I held on just 1-2 days more, could've squeezed out a lot more profit.  It also popped up after earnings, so technically would've made a lot more, though I dont want to make a habit of holding through earnings.

## Notes and Lessons

It's nice to see some profits again, but I will need about 10 more weeks in a row like this to be positive overall again ðŸ˜…

The market had a huge bullish surge last week which helped a lot.

### CSCO Naked Puts

`CSCO` also continues to trend up rather drastically, so my naked put expired worthless (i.e. profitable).

Contemplating whether I should keep selling naked puts on it or not.  

My roughly calculated value entry price is actually around $60, so based on <a href="/naked-put-strategy/">my strategy</a> I should keep selling puts on it until then.  Always easier said than done.

The chart looks great though.
