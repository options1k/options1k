Things got a bit out of control this week.

I was trading everything and anything.  

Resulted in a big loss, and more big losses to potentially come soon.

Too many trades to go through individually, but here's a screenshot of the trades I opened and closed.


**Opened:**
- BA, RUT (x2), IBM, TGT (x2), MU (x2), DLR, GIS, WFC, ADBE (x2), SYF

## Notes and Lessons

Through my reckless trading this week, I learned a few things:
- Announcements of related companies have a big effect
- Don't be overexposed to one industry
- Iron Condors to reduce losses

### NKE, MU and effects of related company news
{% image "img/nike-trade.png", "Trades closed" %}

My `NKE` position was initially doing well.  I entered at the ðŸ˜€, and it bounced off support just like I had hoped. I could've taken profits right there, but it looked like it would keep going up a bit more. 

Then, Foot Locker released some terrible ass earnings and took a nose dive.  This caused NKE to also plummet, as they sell their shoes at Foot Locker?  

I decided to cut my losses at the ðŸ˜©.  Biggest loss to date of about $190.

So, the lesson here is maybe I need to also be aware of earnings of tightly related companies.

This trade got me annoyed, so I started just trading everything I could to make back my loss.

Then, the exact same thing happened, but in the opposite direction, with `MU`.

I was bearish on `MU`, as it had spiked up, but had bad earnings a month ago, and some recent bad news out of China.  So, I thought it was due to drop a bit.  

But, then `NVDA` released amazing earnings, so all the microchip and tech companies boomed up with it. This brings me to the next point:

### Overexposure to one industry

In my recklessness earlier in the week, I entered too many similar positions in the same industry.  I was already in a bearish trade in `MU`, but then also entered a bearish trade in `ADBE`.  Adobe is not a chip company, but they're all big tech industry, so they still move together on major news.

So, now I'm stuck in two of the same positions sitting at big losses.  

### Iron Condor to reduce Credit Spread Loss
Instead of taking my losses right now, I have decided to try an 'Iron Condor' <a href="https://optionalpha.com/lessons/call-spread-adjustments">adjustment strategy</a> to reduce/limit my loss.

*How it works:*
Initially on `ADBE`, I sold a Bear Call Credit Spread (420/425 strikes) for $78.  So, my max risk is $422 (per position). 

The price then moved up against my position.  I could've taken my loss, but instead I sold a Bull Put Spread (340/335 strike) for $70.  I don't take on anymore risk, as it is the same width in strike prices ($5).  Now, my max risk per is just $352 ($422- $70).

If the stock price keeps moving up, I can roll the Put Spread up to reduce my total risk further.

I'm thinking I will still end up taking a loss, but hopefully I can reduce it to something more manageable.  

We'll see how this all works out next week!
