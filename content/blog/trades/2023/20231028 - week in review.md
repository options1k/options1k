I got lucky.

Four weeks in a row of profit.

`MSFT` spiked up off of good earnings, so a few of my long positions closed for profits.

Other than that, not much happened.  

I took a few new long positions.  Market turned down, so they may all end up becoming decent sized losses next week.  

We'll see.

Poor entry on `NVDA`.  My order didn't get filled the previous day, then it bounced up.  I got annoyed and chased it, worried that I would miss out on a run.  Then, it collapsed down over the new couple days.  ðŸ™ƒ

Don't chase stuff.  There's always another opportunity.

Also, only opened 1 qty on `AMAT` trade by mistake (should've been 2 to stay consistent).

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $399.04

Three of my long MSFT positions closed thanks to a good earnings report, netting me $300+

So far, the <a href="https://options1k.com/90dte-msft-strategy/">MSFT strategy</a> has been the best performing strategy.

`DIS` short closed for nice profit as well.  Possibly should have tried to get more profit % out of it.

## Notes and Lessons

Maybe my best week ever so far? In terms of profit anyways.

Not getting too excited.  Still $2k+ in the hole. ðŸ˜‚

About 80% of the profit was just because `MSFT` had a great earnings report and gapped up huge on the open.  

If it had bad earnings, I would probably be crapping my pants right now.

Market has turned very bearish the last couple weeks, and I have a bunch of long positions still.

Next couple months may be a bloodbath to my account if it continues.

Will try and stick the course, regardless.
