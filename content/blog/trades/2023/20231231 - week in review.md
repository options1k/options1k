Merry Christmas!

Last week of trading for 2023.  

It was a profitable week, though could have been a lot better if I had just stuck to my plan.

Weekly `SPY` position, plus three new bullish positions.

Maybe shouldn't have gone into the `DIS` trade as it's been in a super hard downtrend the whole year.  Looked like it might be breaking the trend, though probably not.  Guess we'll find out next year!

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $181.78

Made some money, but could've been a lot better if I had stuck to my plan with `CELH`.

I held the position for over a month (36 days), and it basically did nothing the whole time (down a bit, up a bit).  

It finally had big movement in my favor last week, and I decided to close it early, before my 50% target.  I was scared of losing any profits after waiting so long, and didn't want to be stuck holding it for longer.  If I just held for 1 more day, I would've easily hit my 50% target (extra $30 or so).  Bleh! Stick to the plan!

## Notes and Lessons

Nice to finish the year on a positive note.

Could've been better, but I guess it could always be.

Will be looking at adjust some of my strategies, or adding some new ones next year.

Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year!
