Everything was going so well ... until it wasn't.

Things fell apart this week.  My experiment from <a hre="https://options1k.com/trades-2023-09-11/">last week</a> backfired, and turned into a big loss.

Then, I panicked and started opening more positions to try and reduce my losses which ended up in more losses.

Sigh.  Another *expensive* learning experience ...

## Opened / Assigned

My short put on `CSCO` got assigned one week early.  CSCO had a huge gap down after they acquired some other company.  Not sure why, but that's how it goes...

- SPY (x3)
- AAPL
- MSFT
- MCD
- SO
- CSCO (assigned 100 shares)

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: -$694.82

## Notes and Lessons

Gave back basically all my profits from the last three weeks.

My mental game let me down.  Let emotions and panic get the better of me. 

### `SPY` mistakes
`SPY` started plummeting after some interest rate news.  I thought it wasn't such a big deal, but the market thought otherwise (which is what matters ðŸ˜‚).

The additional bull position I took on SPY last week ended up backfiring, and turned into a big loser. Tried cutting my loss like a good trader, but the market had big gap down, and my order didn't get filled.  So, I ended up taking a loss 3x the size I wanted.

I also took a loss on the original weekly bull posiiton a bit late, although not *too* bad.

I actually entered a bear position early when the market looked like it was going down. Then, a couple days later I entered ANOTHER bull position (unintentionally making an iron condor), thinking it wouldn't drop any more.  Of course, the market dropped just below my short put strike, and I ended up losing another $76.

If I had just stuck with my <a href="https://options1k.com/spy-10day-strategy/">original strategy</a>, and not fucked around so much, I would've only lost around $200. 

### Adding to winner experiment
The main loss this week was from the additional position I took in `SPY` in an attempt to "add to winners".

I realize now that adding another credit spread with a later expiry date is introducing too much risk.  It would've been better to add a position with the same expiry (though this would've also lost money).  

Of course, if the market continued upwards, I would've thought I was a genius. ðŸ¤”

Perhaps, I should've closed out my original position early for a profit, then took another position at the original expiry, but higher strike prices (i.e. rolling).  Something to think about for next time.


### `CSCO` assigned
My short put on `CSCO` got assigned a week early.  I should've rolled it out again after the big drop in price last week, but I did not.

So, now I have 100 shares of `CSCO` to sell call options on.  

My original cost is $57/share.  When factoring in profits from naked puts ( $105), my cost is about $56/share. 

So, as long as I can sell covered calls at $56 strike, I'll be breakeven.

The problem is that the price dropped a bit too much (currently $53), so I'm receiving barely any premium for selling calls at $56-57.  That's the risk of naked puts.
