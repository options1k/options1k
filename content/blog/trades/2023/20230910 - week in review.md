Been reading this trading book recently called "Best Loser Wins".  

One of the main points of the book is to keep adding to winners, instead of just closing at a predetermined profit (e.g. 50% profit).

I tried to think how I should apply this concept to selling credit spreads.  

So, I tried adding to an existing put credit spread that I thought would definitely expire out of the money:

## Opened
I added to my `SPY` bull put spread that was set to expire in a couple days.  It ended up working out, and I made an extra $7.50 off of it.  It could of been risky if there was a big drop suddenly though. ðŸ¤”

Also sold another naked put on `CSCO`, and continued with my weekly `MSFT` strategy.

## Closed / Expired:
Closed a couple more positions for nice profits.  Trying not to get too excited though.

## Notes and Lessons
I guess another way to "add to winners" for credit spreads would be simply to open more positions with different expiry.  For example, if `SPY` is in a great uptrend, I could just open new positions everyday with 10DTE (or some other time frame).

Not really sure, need to think about it more.

Will continue experimenting next week.
