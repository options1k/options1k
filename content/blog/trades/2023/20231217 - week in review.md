My self-sabotage from <a href="/trades-2023-11-27/">a couple weeks ago</a> is complete.

One big losing trade ruined what otherwise would have been a decent week.

Made it even worse by not taking my loss one or two days earlier.  Damn it.

Opened a couple positions based on my <a href="/long-term-trend-strategy/">long term trend strategy</a> (`MCD`, `V`).  Completely forgot to do it last month.  Doubled up my position on `V` because `PG` doesn't have any 90 day options available.  Think I will add another `MCD` next week too, as my strategy is to have around $5k risk.

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $-119.72

Big loss on `BILL`.  I tried to take my loss earlier, but then it gapped up and I got f*cked.  I actually should've closed it MANY days earlier when it was pretty clear that it wasn't going to go back down.

Wrecked what would've been a $200+ profitable week. ðŸ˜­

Also, should've let `SMCI` run a bit more.  

## Notes and Lessons

That's now two weeks in a row of losses.  

After 8 weeks of wins, seems like I lost my focus a bit and started gambling on setups that weren't optimal.

Poor trade management.  Hoping and wishing instead of just cutting losses like I should.  

When I realized that I shouldn't have entered a position in the first place, I should just close it for whatever small loss, instead of holding on and hoping it works out in my favour.
