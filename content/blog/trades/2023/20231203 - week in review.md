I entered some questionable trades this week.

Even though I knew I shouldn't have.  Perhaps, I was bored.  Itching to do something.  Like a moth to the flame.  

Then, I read something about how people do stuff to sabotage their own success, because subconsciously they feel they don't deserve to do well.

Is that why I do stupid things?  I'm not sure.  I hope not.


## Opened

<div class="trade-table weekly full-width">

|**Ticker**|**Action**|**Type**|**Date**|**Expiry**|**Sell Strike**|**Buy Strike**|**Premium**|**Qty**|**Fee**|**Net**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|SPY|open|BPS|2023-11-28|2023-12-08|445|436|0.44|1|2.08|41.92|
|MSFT|open|BPS|2023-11-28|2023-03-15|335|320|1.58|1|2.09|155.91|
|ENPH|open|BCS|2023-11-30|2023-01-19|120|125|0.67|2|1.09|132.91|
|BILL|open|BCS|2023-12-01|2023-01-19|75|80|0.7|2|0.23|139.77|
|WMT|open|BPS|2023-12-01|2023-01-19|150|145|0.65|2|1.37|128.63|

</div>

`ENPH`, `WMT`, and `BILL` were all less than optimal looking trades, but I entered all of them anyways. ðŸ˜…
 
 They are all currently sitting at losses, so next week may not be so nice.  We'll see.

## Closed / Expired:


<div class = "trade-table monthly full-width">

|**Ticker**|**Action**|**Type**|**Date**|**Expiry**|**Sell Strike**|**Buy Strike**|**Premium**|**Qty**|**Fee**|**Net**|**Profit/Loss**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|SPY|open|BPS|2023-11-21|2023-12-01|444|436|0.39|1|2.48|36.52|$36.52|
|SPY|expired|BPS|2023-12-01|2023-12-01|436|444|0|1|0|0|

</div>

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $36.52

Weekly `SPY` position closed/expired for tiny profits.  Better than nothing!


## Notes and Lessons

Overall market continued upward this week.  That's 5 weeks in a row of positive gains.

It's right at the top of the last swing up, so we'll see next week if it can breakthrough or not.  If it does, then seems like we're going to be testing all time highs soon:
