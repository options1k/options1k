Maybe the hardest part about trading is patience.

Patience to wait for a good setup.  

Then, when the setup ends up not working out (which is 50% of the time), you still have to be patient for the next setup.

If not, you end up overtrading, and chasing "missed" opportunities.

Slow week; market shot up, then shot back down.

## Opened

Only two new positions opened this week:

- SPY
- ORCL

Maybe shouldn't have opened the weekly SPY position, because the premium was super low.  Just trying to stick to the plan though.

## Closed / Expired:
Bunch of trades closed thanks to the up spike at the beginning of the week.  

Took profits early on `QQQ` because I was scared that the war would cause market panic.  Ended up being a mistake, should've let it run.  

Commissions on `IWM` are super high.  Need to take this into consideration next time.

Took small losses on a couple positions that I wasn't happy with.

## Notes and Lessons

A small profitable week.

I'm more satisfied about the small losses I took on `SBUX` and `TXN`.  

Instead of hoping they would bounce higher, I decided to just cut them off.  I didn't really like the look of the charts, so I just go rid of them.  I can use the capital on another position instead.

Of course, if either of them bounce up hard next week, I'm going to think why the F did I sell early. I guess that's trading ðŸ˜…
