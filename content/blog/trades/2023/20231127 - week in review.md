Market remains very bullish.

Makes it hard to find good entries on new positions.

Market is nearing a major resistance level though; we'll see if it retraces or not over the next couple weeks.

Very quiet week for new positions.  My `MSFT` strategy was already maxed out, so I didn't open new positions.

Followed through with weekly `SPY` position, and opened one new position in `CELH`.  It didn't move much at all.

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $149.14

Market has been super bullish, so everything keeps going up recently.  I don't have any bear positions at all.

Should've maybe targetted more profit on `MSFT` as it keeps pushing all time highs. 


## Notes and Lessons

8 weeks in a row of profit.

It's great, but trying to stay grounded.  

I'm going to lose a trade soon.  I can feel it. ðŸ˜…
