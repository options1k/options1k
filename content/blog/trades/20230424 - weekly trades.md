This past week (April 17th - 21st, 2023), I opened 2 new positions, and closed 2 existing positions.  

It was difficult to find many good trade setups this week. I also took my biggest loss on a trade (so far).

Opened:
- EA
- RUT

Closed:
- GLD
- ATVI

Let's take a look in more detail:

## Opened Positions 
I opened one Bull Put Spread (BPS), and one Bear Call Spreads (BCS) this week.

### 1. **EA** (*BCS*)
  - Opened: 04/19/2023
  - Expiry date: 05/19/2023
  - IV%: 55%
  - Current price: 130
  - Sell call @ 140
  - Buy call @ 145
  - Premium collected: $65 / contract
  - Volume: 2
<br /><br />
  **Notes**:<br />
  EA has been in a strong uptrend the past month, but in the longer term (9mos-1 year) it has been in a flat range, or slight downtrend.  It's nearing some major resistance at the 130-133 price area, and overbought, so should at least pull back a bit towards the 20-ma. Hopefully.


### 2. **RUT** (*BPS*) / Already expired out the money
  - Opened: 04/19/2023
  - Expiry date: 04/20/2023
  - IV%: ?
  - Sell put @ 1780
  - Buy put @ 1775  
  - Premium collected: $90 / contract
  - Volume: 1
<br /><br />
  **Notes**:<br />
    This was a new kind of trade for me.  RUT ... i.e. the Russell 2000 index.  I was watching some random video about European options, and the guy mentioned trading RUT.  I looked at the chart, then the options table, and it seemed like a good setup and profit margin.  So, I entered a trade without thinking much.  It expired already, so I ended up making $87 (after fees).  I should probably understand how these options actually work before trading them again though.


## Closed Positions
Closed 2 positions, one for my biggest loss so far.

### 1. **GLD** (BCS)
  - Opened: 04/12/2023
  - Closed: 04/17/2023
  - Total days: 5
  - Premium received: $57 / contract
  - Premium paid: $41 / contract
  - Volume: 2
  - Net Profit (after commissions): $22
<br /><br >
  **Notes**:
    I was not happy with my entry on this trade <a href="/trades-april-10-14/">last week</a>, so I decided to just get out of it.  Luckily managed to take a small profit.  If I had held on, I would probably have a bigger profit right now, but that's fine with me.

### 2. **ATVI** (BCS)
  - Opened: 03/30/2023
  - Closed: 04/21/2023
  - Total days: 22
  - Premium received: $99 / contract
  - Premium paid: $129 / contract
  - Volume: 3
  - Net Profit (after commissions): -$90.87
<br /><br />
  **Notes**:
    Was also not happy with <a href="/this-week-s-trades-apr-3-7-2023/">entry on this trade</a> as I completely looked at the chart wrong ðŸ˜‚.  After realizing this, I should have just exited right away, but I held on hoping and praying it would work out somehow.  It did not.  Earnings next week, so decided it was time to pull the plug.



## Summary Notes and Thoughts
Got lucky making a random trade on RUT.  Managed to cancel out my loss on ATVI.  I'll need to learn how these European options actually work to see if it's something I can use every week or not.

This week was really slow overall; couldn't find anything to sell through my typical scan setups.  Market hasn't been very volatile recently, so maybe I need to adjust for these conditions.  Or, I need to learn a new strategy to use. 

Have four open positions right now (GILD, ETSY, TSN, EA).  GILD has suddenly gone against me, so will probably be taking a loss on that soon.

I've decided to lower my <a href="rules/#risk-level-trade-sizing">risk level </a> to 1% per trade (down from 2%).  I've realized I'm still not comfortable with the 2% level, and haven't been following it consistently.
