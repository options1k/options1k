Saw some potential profits disappear this past week.

Didn't take a loss, but still annoying.

Overall, a profitable week, so can't complain too much.

A few more bullish positions.  Market continutes trending up, so just sticking with the trend.

Opened a naked short put on `CSCO`.  This is the second time I've tried it; the first time didn't work out so well for me.

Is it gonna f me up again? Maybe.

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $274.05

I had a bearish position on `ENPH`, and it was doing pretty well initially.  It was *super close* to hitting my 50% target profit (i.e like $0.01 away).  

Then, the price suddenly gapped/spiked up against my position.  I decided to close it for around break-even, instead of seeing it go into the red.

## Notes and Lessons

Nice little profit.  Could've been a lot better, but then again -- it could've been worse.

Kicking myself a bit for not closing `ENPH` early, as I was really considering it before it spiked against me.  Oh well.  I stuck to the plan, which is a good thing.

### CSCO Naked Put - Round 2

Haven't messed around with <a href="/naked-put-strategy/">naked puts</a> for awhile, but decided to open a naked short put on `CSCO`.

About <a href="/trades-2023-09-04/">6 months ago</a>, I also sold a naked put on `CSCO`.

I was way too aggressive with my strike price selection, as I thought it was getting ready for a big bull run.

A couple weeks later, it tanked, and I ended up getting assigned 100 shares at the very high price of $57. The stock is now around $48. ðŸ˜­

So, I'm sitting on like an $800 loss right now (after collected premiums, dividends, etc.)

I was thinking about what to do with the shares.  Take my loss?  Leave it?  Double down?

After a quick, elementary analysis, I decided the stock is undervalued.  So, I am doubling down!

I'm looking for the stock to get to around $60/share; we'll see how it goes.
