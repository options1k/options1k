Not a great start to the year.

Guess the markets were due for a pullback after a fairly crazy bull run the past couple months.

Managed to stick to my plan more or less, which was good.

## Opened

Weekly `SPY` and `MSFT` position, plus couple more bullish positions.

Should start looking for some bearish positions possibly, but there weren't many good looking ones.

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: -$28.45

`AAPL` tanked just a week after hitting an all-time high. Managed to get out, but it opened with a huge gap down, so loss was maybe a bit larger than I had hoped.


## Notes and Lessons
Happy that I was able to cut my loss on `AAPL` and stick to my trading plan.

Market is looking a bit shaky to start the year.  I only have bullish positions right now, so may be looking to take some more losses soon.

In any case, as long as I cut my losses accordingly, I should be fine, right?
