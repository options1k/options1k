Very choppy week.

Looked like market was going to finish with a big loss, but then it had a huge rally in literally the last 20 minutes of the day to finish the week just slightly down.

Lucky for me, because it looked like I was going to eat some major losses otherwise.

Opened a bunch of new positions; I think I'm getting a bit restless:

Weekly `SPY` and `MSFT` trades.

New covered call on `CSCO` as I'm trying to get rid of 100 shares that I was assigned last week.  Unfortunately, it dropped some more, and is in a short downtrend right now.

Naked put on `BITO`, which is a bitcoin ETF.  No fundamentals to really consider, but I am bullish on bitcoin long term.  Very speculative position, but it's low priced, so just sort of messing around.

## Closed / Expired:

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $176.58

Just the weekly `SPY` position closed/expired.  Looked like it was going to close for a loss, but got lucky in the end.

## Notes and Lessons

Ended the month on a positive note.

Have a couple positions that I may need to take a loss on soon though, so next month may start in the negative.

### Scaling up
I started scaling up my weekly `SPY` positions.  I went from a quantity of 2 to 3.  It also bit me in the ass right away as the market started to drop, but I got fortunate in the end.

### Unbalanced portfolio

I have way too many bullish positions right now.  Also, all my strategies are basically bullish (or neutral).  Whenever the market has a downturn, I typically end up with losses.

I need to find a way to better diversify my holdings or take more bearish positions somehow.  

Most of the positions I have are in either tech or consumer based industries.  So, perhaps need to trade more in like oil or gold?  Below is a correlation matrix from Option Alpha:

Need to research some bearish strategies that I can look at consistently.
