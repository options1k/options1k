Good finish to the month.

Shortened week, and I was coming back from a trip, so didn't do too much.

Opened a few new trades, while a few positions closed/expired:


## Opened

<div class="trade-table weekly full-width">

|**Ticker**|**Action**|**Type**|**Date**|**Expiry**|**Sell Strike**|**Buy Strike**|**Premium**|**Qty**|**Fee**|**Net**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|SPY|open|BPS|2024-03-26|2024-04-05|511|502|0.59|2|2.79|115.21|
|AMD|open|BPS|2024-03-27|2024-05-17|160|155|1.29|2|1.48|256.52|

Nothing too exciting.  `AMD` had a really good premium, and is in a nice uptrend, so got sucked in even though entry maybe was not ideal.  

Doubled up typical monthly position on `PG` (2 instead of 1), because premium is so low.  Maybe should not bother with it, but just trying to stick to the plan.

- **Closed Net Profits/Loss**: $275.41

`MRVL` spiked up slightly, so managed to close it just 5 days after opening.

## Notes and Lessons

Good end to a month which started out negative.

Market has been going almost straight up for the last 4 months, so basically any bullish position has ended up profitable.

Have been slowly looking at testing some more strategies out, or adding companies to my <a href="/long-term-trend-strategy/">long-term strategy</a>.  Maybe will test some things out next month.
