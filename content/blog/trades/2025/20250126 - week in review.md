Happy Chinese New Year! üêç

The market hit new highs, and it was a decent week for me too.

My 0DTE trades were profitable, and a position I entered over 1 year ago finally closed!

More details below.  First, here's my trades for the week:

## Opened:

Just a couple probability based trades, and a weekly [45+ DTE SPY trade](/spy-45dte-strategy/).


## Closed / Expired:

### Other trades

One weekly SPY position, and a `BITO` dividend capture play from a month ago closed.  Maybe should've have just held on to `BITO` as it will be ex-dividend again in a couple weeks.  But, I can just enter again I guess.

### CSCO Trade

I first entered `CSCO` short put back in August 2023.  I ended up getting assigned at $57 in September 2023 -- approximately one year and 4 months ago.  

The stock immediately tanked, continued downtrending all the way to $45.  

It finally recovered a couple months ago (November 2023), and I was able to take my profits last week.  

Stupid thing is, I should've patient for one more week, because now it is $2 higher than my sell price. üòÖ

### 0DTE Trades

Was a good week for my 0DTE trades. Nine out of 11 trades closed for profit.  Had some software issues at the beginning of the week, otherwise could've been even better.

## Notes, Lessons and Thoughts

Wow, best week ever?

Mostly thanks to my 1+ year position in CSCO.  I don't know if that should count for this week, or if I should split it up over the 16 or so months I was in the trade. I guess it doesn't matter. üòÇ

### The 1.5 year CSCO Trade

As mentioned earlier, I got assigned on a short put at $57 in September 2023 -- approximately one year and 4 months ago.  

The stock then immediately tanked to $52, and continued on a terrible down trend all the way to $45.  

This meant I could not sell covered calls on it at my average cost per share which was around $56.

So, I was basically stuck with 100 shares.

`CSCO` is a major $200 billion company which is consitently profitable.  It didn't seem that it would go out of business soon (but you never know).  So, I decided to keep holding the shares.  

Based on my own valuation, and looking at other valuations online, I felt `CSCO` was worth $60+ per share.  So, I held.  And, held...and held. It did nothing for a long time.

The company pays a 3%-4% dividend, so that helped soften the blow a tiny bit.  I also sold some more puts at lower prices which made me a couple hundred dollars (not included in this trade).

Finally, the stock began to recover late last year.  Around November 2024, I could've closed it for a small profit, but I decided to sell covered calls at my target exit price ($60).

The stock broke through $60 last week, and my covered call got assigned, finally closing my 100 shares. 

If I was just a tiny bit more patient, I could've got even more out of it, as the stock is now at $62+. Damn it. üôÉ

My return on this position was actually not very good...probably less than 10% annual return? (not including dividends)

It feels good to finally close it though.  My account had a -$10k cash balance, so I was starting to pay a bit too much interest.
