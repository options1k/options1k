Here are the trades I made over the past week and a bit.

I've included a few trades from March, because I forgot to write a post for last week.

In total, I opened five trades, and closed none so far.

Four of the trades are Bear Call Spreads, and one is a Bull Put Spread.

## Bear Call Spreads 

1. **ATVI**
  - Opened: 03/30/2023
  - Expiry date: 05/19/2023
  - Sell call @ 90
  - Buy call @ 95
  - Premium collected: $100 / contract
  - Volume: 3
<br />
  **Notes**:
    I looked at the chart wrong, and didn't notice the huge gap up ðŸ˜….  I probably shouldn't have entered the trade in the first place, but we'll see how it goes.  I'll cut losses according to my <a href="/rules/">trading rules</a> if things go wrong.

2. **IBM**
  - Opened: 03/30/2023
  - Expiry date: 05/19/2023
  - Sell call @ 140
  - Buy call @ 145
  - Premium collected: $73 / contract
  - Volume: 1
<br />
  **Notes**:
    Took this trade idea from Gin at passiveseeds.com

3. **GILD**
  - Opened: 04/04/2023
  - Expiry date: 05/19/2023
  - Sell call @ 90
  - Buy call @ 92.5
  - Premium collected: $35 / contract
  - Volume: 4
<br />
  **Notes**:
    Realized I should have doubled the volume on this, because the buy/call spread is only 2.5 instead of 5.  Also premium collected is only $35 per.

4. **AMZN**
  - Opened: 04/04/2023
  - Expiry date: 05/19/2023
  - Sell call @ 115
  - Buy call @ 120
  - Premium collected: $78 / contract
  - Volume: 2
<br />
  **Notes**:
    Amazon has been in a slow and steady downtrend for awhile.  Hoping the trend continues, although looks like it may be reversing or flattening out a bit.  Make sure to exit position regardless before earnings announcement April 27.


## BULL PUT SPREADS
1. **COIN**
  - Opened: 03/30/2023
  - Expiry date: 05/19/2023
  - Sell call @ 40
  - Buy call @ 35
  - Premium collected: $67 / contract
  - Volume: 2
<br />
  **Notes**:
    Wasn't so sure about this trade, but wanted a bullish position to balance out the bearish ones. COIN was oversold with bunch of support levels nearby. Only took small position.


## Notes:
It seems I have too many bear positions right now, but there were not many stocks that were oversold this past week.  Maybe I need to start looking at some other indicators besides stochastics?
