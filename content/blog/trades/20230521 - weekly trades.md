Closed a lot of positions this week.  Opened a few new ones as well.  Decided to sort of ignore Implied Volatility Percentage, and just trade mainly based on stochastics.  Worked out OK this week.

**Opened:**
- NFLX
- ADBE
- SLB
- NKE

**Closed:**
- CSCO
- XOP
- MS
- RUT
- NFLX
- ADBE

Let's take a look in more detail:

## Opened Positions 
I opened four new positions this week: one Bear Call Spread (BCS), and three Bull Put Spreads (BPS).

### 1. **NFLX** (*BCS*)
  - Opened: 05/15/2023
  - Expiry date: 06/16/2023
  - IV %: 3%
  - Current price: 340
  - Sell @ 375
  - Buy @ 380
  - Premium collected: $66 / contract
  - Volume: 2
<br /><br />
  **Notes**:<br />
  Here's one trade where I ignored the super low IV Percentile (3%). `NFLX` was overbought, and trading in a sideways range. 340 was a recent resistant level.  Closed it 2 days later for profit.

### 2. **ADBE** #1 (*BPS*) 
  - Opened: 05/16/2023
  - Expiry date: 06/16/2023
  - IV %: 24%
  - Current Price: 345
  - Sell @ 310
  - Buy @ 305
  - Premium collected: $62 / contract
  - Volume: 2
<br /><br />
  **Notes**:<br />
  `ADBE` has been sideways range for this entire year basically.  Oversold, coming off major support level at 340.  More support at 320-325 area.  IV Percentile lower than what I usually want, but not too bad.  Stock went up as I hoped, and I took profits 2 days later.

### 3. **SLB** (*BPS*) 
  - Opened: 05/16/2023
  - Expiry date: 06/16/2023
  - IV %: 27%
  - Current Price: 44
  - Sell @ 40
  - Buy @ 37.5
  - Premium collected: $30 / contract
  - Volume: 2
<br /><br />
  **Notes**:<br />
  Wasn't too sure about this one, as it seems like there's a big gap to  the next support area.  So, I took a smaller position just in case.  Has been in long term uptrend, but downtrend for this current year.

### 4. **NKE** #2 (*BPS*) 
  - Opened: 05/17/2023
  - Expiry date: 06/16/2023
  - IV%: 12
  - Current Price: 116
  - Sell @ 110
  - Buy @ 105
  - Premium collected: $72 / contract
  - Volume: 2
<br /><br />
  **Notes**:<br />
  `NKE` has been trading sideways this year between $115 and $130.  Oversold near the $115 support, so seemed like a great entry point.  Everything was going as hoped, until Foot Locker released bad earnings which took NKE down with it.  We'll see if it holds the support or not.

## Closed / Expired Positions
Closed 6 positions this week.  All for profit (although some very, very small).
- CSCO
- XOP
- MS
- RUT
- NFLX
- ADBE

### 1. **CSCO** (BPS)
  - Opened: 04/24/2023
  - Closed: 05/15/2023
  - Total days: 21
  - Premium received: $66 / contract
  - Premium paid: $63 / contract
  - Volume: 2
  - Net (after fees): $3
<br /><br >
  **Notes**:
   Held this position for 3 weeks, and it did basically nothing. Closed it a couple days before earnings for breakeven ($3 profit).  `CSCO` then jumped up after positive earnings, so I could've made more, but it's against my rules to hold through earnings.

### 2. **XOP** (BPS): 
  - Opened: 05/03/2023
  - Closed: 05/15/2023
  - Total days: 12
  - Premium received: $0.80 / contract
  - Premium paid: $0.55 / contract
  - Volume: 1
  - Net Profit (after commissions): $22
<br /><br />
  **Notes**:
    `XOP` also did not do much, so decided to take my small profits early while I could.  Only had a very small position, so better to take my capital to use it elsewhere.

### 3. **MS** (BPS): 
  - Opened: 05/08/2023
  - Closed: 05/18/2023
  - Total days: 10
  - Premium received: $0.32 / contract
  - Premium paid: $0.20 / contract
  - Volume: 1
  - Net Profit (after commissions): $6.50
<br /><br />
  **Notes**:
    Another tiny position that I took profits on a bit early.  Banks have all been beaten down recently, so better to take money when you can I guess.  

### 4. **RUT** (BPS): 
  - Opened: 05/11/2023
  - Closed: 05/15/2023
  - Total days: 5
  - Premium received: $0.36 / contract
  - Premium paid: $0.15 / contract
  - Volume: 2
  - Net Profit (after commissions): $32
<br /><br />
  **Notes**:
    One of the short term expiry positions I was messing around with last week.  Closed it early for over 50% profit, but maybe would've been smarter to just let it expire at the end of the week for 100% profit.  Not really sure yet the optimal way to play these short term expiries.  

### 5. **NFLX** (BCS): 
  - Opened: 05/15/2023
  - Closed: 05/17/2023
  - Total days: 2
  - Premium received: $0.66 / contract
  - Premium paid: $0.36 / contract
  - Volume: 2
  - Net Profit (after commissions): $57
<br /><br />
  **Notes**:
    Opened and closed within 2 days for nearly 50%.  Awesome.  Good thing I closed it early, because it spiked up a couple days later and I would've suffered a decent loss on it.

### 6. **ADBE** (BCS): 
  - Opened: 05/16/2023
  - Closed: 05/18/2023
  - Total days: 2
  - Premium received: $0.62 / contract
  - Premium paid: $0.40 / contract
  - Volume: 2
  - Net Profit (after commissions): $41
<br /><br />
  **Notes**:
    Another position which was opened and closed within 2 days.  I took profits quickly on this one as well (35%), as it seemed to be hitting a recent resistance area.  In this case, I should've held longer as I would've made the full 50% a day later.  Oh well.



## Summary Notes and Thoughts
I took a whole bunch of small profits this week for a **total of about $165**.

Not bad!

It seems like taking profits early is often better than trying to wait for the price to actually hit my 50% target profit margin, or holding to expiry.  If you look at an annualized return, it almost always makes more sense (e.g. 30% in 5 days vs. 50% over 15 days).

Still a bit difficult finding optimal trading setups due to low volatility.  So, for now it seems like I will need to lower or ignore my IV% requirements
