Bearish week.

Luckily, I had some bearish positions that worked out.

Unfortunately, also had some bullish positions that did not.

## Closed / Expired:
Cut my loss a tiny, tiny bit late on `SPY` trade.  Improvement over before though, which is good, I guess.

Forgot to put a profit taking order on `ORCL` trade, which ended up working out in my favor.  By the time I realized, I was able to close it for around 75% profit instead of the typical 50%.

## Notes and Lessons

Another small profitable week. 

More happy that I was able to stick to my plan and cut my loss on `SPY` trade at around 200%.

Contemplating if I should stop using 50% profit taking orders on my <a href="https://options1k.com/gin-lim-strategy/">basic selling strategy</a>.  Not using one worked out in my favor on the `ORCL` trade, but would've backfired had I done the same with `CRM`. Hmmm.

### New Strategy
Started to commit to another new strategy -- selling 90+ day put spreads on fundamentally sound companies that are in long term uptrends.  For now, I have selected three stocks --  `V`, `MCD`, `PG`

Actually started testing the strategy out last month with Visa (`V`) and McDonald's (`MCD`).  `MCD` has plummeted 10% since then, so not such a good start to my test. ðŸ˜…

Will risk around $5k on this strategy for now.
