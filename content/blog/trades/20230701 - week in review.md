To make up for my lack of trades last week, I entered a ton of positions this week (11).

Probably too many.

I also decided to hold through earnings for a couple positions (`GIS` and `MU`). Both backfired.  GIS had poor earnings, and tanked.  MU had good earnings, but still tanked a day later for whatever reason. Bleh ðŸ˜© 

Also testing out a new strategy with `MSFT` that I found on Options Alpha.  Basically, selling super far out, and high probability put credit spreads (90 days to expiry, 0.15/0.05 Delta).

## Opened:
- MSFT
- RUT
- SQ
- TJX
- TSLA x2 (iron condor)
- ATVI
- XLE
- PDD
- BAX
- EMR

## Notes and Lessons

I've realized that I have completely abandoned my original trading rules -- mainly cutting losses, and exiting before earnings.  Things have not gone so well since I have.

It may be time to reset, and just ignore whatever exisiting profits/losses I have accummulated.

I have a bunch of positions that are just sitting at big losses.  And they all expire in July.  So, I'm probably going to be reset anyways hahaha.

I've also realized that I make profits everytime I trade `RUT`.  I should really figure out what I'm doing right, or is it just luck?
