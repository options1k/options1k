This is a naked put selling strategy that I have pieced together from <a href="https://www.passiveseeds.com">Gin Lim</a> and <a href="https://great-option-trading-strategies.com/">Brad Castro</a>

## Basic overview
Sell puts on *profitable, high quality* companies that I would like to own in the long term.

## Detailed Overview
Still ironing out the details, but here's what I got so far.

### Company / stock selection
1. Profitable (Net Margin > 15%)
2. Earnings & Revenue growth over past 5 years (and forseeable future)
3. Manageable debt levels (i.e. low D/E ratio, or great interest coverage)
4. Return on Equity > 15%
5. Good cash flow / quality of earnings
6. High option volume (preferably with weekly options available)

### Entry rules
1. Sell put at calculated target entry price (i.e. fundamentally attractive price that I want to own the stock at)
2. Collected premium should give annualized return > 15% (e.g. put option with 30DTE should have at least 1.25% return)
3. 

### Exit options
There are a few exit options/outcomes for naked puts:

1. **Option expires worthless**
- If stock price never goes below strike, then just collect premium. 

2. **Close position early** 
- If stock price jumps up significantly in a short time, it will probably be worth it to close position early (based on annualized return).

3. **Assigned** 
- If stock price drops below put strike and shares are assigned, it is not a bad thing, because it is a company that I want to own for long term.  
- If something has changed in the company though that has fundamentally reduced target price, then I should just sell for a loss.
- Otherwise, start selling call options on newly owned shares that generate 5% annualized cash flow
- Sell all shares at calculated target exit price

### Allocation / Risk amount
Controlling amount of risk is maybe the most important part of selling naked puts.

I am going to start conservative and limit myself to around $5,000 - $6,000 of *cash* risk.

That means I can only sell ***one*** put option on a stock with $50 - $60 price. (i.e. 100 shares x $50 = $5000)


## Summary / Notes
Selling naked puts is how I blew up my account in 2022.  

Mainly, I was way overleveraged (basically maxed out my margin), and was playing with some super volatile companies.  I didn't really understand what I was doing, but was making money so kept going.

When the market started tanking, I got caught with my pants down.

I've learned a lot since then, so hopefully can do a bit better this time. Hopefully. ðŸ™ƒ
