*Update Jan 2025:*

I haven't been using this strategy for the past few months.  It was actually very profitable for me when I did use it.

It works very well in bull markets, and I got lucky and made a bunch of money in the 2024 market boom. Despite this, I have decided it takes on too much risk for my portfolio size.  I have decided to shift to a a more conservative 45+ DTE strategy instead.

Perhaps I will start trading this strategy again when I have a bigger account. *

I wanted a strategy that I could trade every week to relieve the itchy trigger finger (i.e. that need to make a trade feeling).

Maybe this is not the most optimal strategy, but it'll keep me busy.

I ran some backtests on <a href="https://optionalpha.com">optionalpha.com</a>, and the returns are OK, outperforming basic `SPY` CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate).

## Basic overview
*Every week* sell a `SPY` 10 day to expiry (DTE) bull put spread at 0.15/.05 delta.  

### Entry rules
Every Monday or Tuesday, sell a 10 DTE credit spread on SPY (i.e. Sell put @ 0.15 delta, buy call @ 0.05 delta).

### Exit rules
No profit taking.  Just let it run to expiry.

Stop loss at approximate 200% of credit received.

### Allocation amount
Will start with selling 1 spread per week, and work my way up (or down) from there.

## Summary / Notes
This is a simple trading strategy to help relieve the itch every week.

The main downside is that you will still take a decent losses, especially on market downturns.  

Based on backtests, max drawdown over the past 5 years is around 20-30%.

Also, not sure about the stop loss amount, but according to the backtests, it helps in the long run.  So, we'll just go with it for now.
