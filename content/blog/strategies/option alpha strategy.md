<a href="https://optionalpha.com/">Option Alpha</a> is a great resource for learning about trading options.  They also have their own app/platform that lets you auto-trade strategies.   Their platform doesn't work with my broker yet (IBKR), otherwise I would probably be using it.

The platform also has "trade ideas" screener which gives you high probability / expected value trades.  

## Overview
The main idea touted by Option Alpha is to use a very mathematical approach, and the "law of large numbers".  

Basically, make a lot trades that have good probability/return on risk/expected value.  

As long as you control your risk (i.e position size), you will eventually come out on top.  

Sounds quite simple doesn't it.

## Entry rules

I will look to make 3-5 trades per week based on "trade ideas" found on the Option Alpha platform.  

Will also be using it to hedge, or diversify my other positions.  

If I have too many bullish positions, I will look for some bearish trades to make.  Or, if I have too many trades on tech companies, will look for other industry to trade.

Other entry rules:
- Reward/Risk must be greater than the percent on this chart depending on dislayed probability of max profit:
{% image "./max profit vs return on risk.png", "probability profit vs reward risk" %}
  - mainly be targetting trades in the 50-65% probability range
- avoid trades where earnings are within 2 weeks (less accurate probabilities)
- prefer trades with high implied volatility rank or IV percentile
- trade symbols that have high volume / open interest (at least 300 each leg)
- only defined risk trades (i.e. credit spreads, iron condors, etc.)
- >20 DTE (<a href="https://optionalpha.com/blog/trade-ideas-performance-days-to-expiration">reason</a>)
- prefer ETFS over stocks (<a href="https://optionalpha.com/blog/evaluating-alpha-the-anticipated-return-on-risk-per-trade">reason</a>) 
- Distribute trades across different expiry dates, so that not everything expires on the same week.  Maybe 2-3 positions per expiry date


## Exit rules
1. Take profit at 50-75% of initial collected premium 
2. No stop loss.  Loss is limited to position size / risk level


## Risk level / Position size

Each trade, I want to risk less than $100.  This is about 0.3% of my portfolio size.  Since I will be making many trades per week, I think it is smarter to have lower risk than 1% of portfolio.

I will first be only targetting $1 - $2 wide spreads.  That will mean my max loss for each position will typically be around $50-$100 (based on 50% probability of max profit).


## Summary / Pros / Cons
Interested to see how this almost purely mathematical approach works.  No need to look at technical indicators or anything.

The good thing is that there is literally always a trade to make if I want to.

The bad thing is that there is too many ideas to trade, and is probably easy to overtrade.

I noticed the platform still lists trades where the spreads are super wide.  So, I will need to be careful when placing my orders.
