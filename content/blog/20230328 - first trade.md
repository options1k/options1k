Here is my first trade.

It was actually opened a couple weeks ago, before I decided to start this blog.

**Here's the opening details:**
- Ticker: SPY
- Trade type: Bull Put Spread (BPS)
- Trade date: 2023-03-14
- Expiry: 2023-04-21 (39 days)
- Current price: $390
- Sell put strike: $366
- Buy put strike: $361
- Total risk: $500
- Spread (Premium collected): $71
- Volume: 1 

I also already closed this trade last week, taking in my first profits!

**Closing details:**
- trade date: 2023-03-21
- stock price: $393
- spread: $34 

- Gross profit = 71-34 = $37

After commissions, I made a **final profit of about $33**. 

This equates to about a 6.6% return over about 6 days.  Annualized over 365 days, that's about a 400% return!  ðŸ˜‚

I should have done higher volume, but it was my first trade, so I was a bit scared. 

If I had traded 5 contracts instead of 1, I would have made a nice $150 or so.

Anyways, I'm happy to complete my first BPS option trade!
