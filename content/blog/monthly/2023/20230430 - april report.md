My first full month of trading is complete!  

I closed 10 trades, and made a profit of $288.  

Made some silly mistakes, and got lucky with a couple.

Here are the trades that I closed in April:

## Notes / Learning points
I was profitable on 80% of the trades.  Woohoo!

I closed a bunch of them early before reaching my 50% target though.  It helped in some cases, but also limited my profits.  

I SHOULD HAVE taken profits early on `GILD` before it swung to a loss.  I wasn't really watching it too closely, so didn't notice the reversal.  Now, I plan to look at my positions at the end of every trading day to see if I should close it.  I think I will base my decision off support/resistances and candlesticks.

The other big loss was on `ATVI`, which I shouldn't have entered in the first place.  I was praying all month that it would drop in my favor, but it never did.  I decided to close it a few days before earnings to take a decent loss.  Funny thing is if I had held it through earnings, I would've made a big profit since they had bad news about its acquisition from Microsoft.  Oh well.

One other major rule change I made for myself this month was to lower my risk per trade.  It was originally at 2%, but I realized I was not yet comfortable making trades at that level.  So, I've lowered it to 1%.  It will limit my profits, but allow me to make more trades and mistakes.

Oh, also hit my <a href="/about/#goals-milestones">first goal</a> of making $100 per month.  Woohoo!
