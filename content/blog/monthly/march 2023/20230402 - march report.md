My first month of trading is complete!  

I closed 4 trades, and made a profit of $198.  Not bad!

It was only half a month really, because I made my first trade on March 14th.  So, it could have been a lot better (or worse).

Here are the trades that were closed in March:

## Notes / Learning points
I was profitable on 3 of the 4 trades.  

The one trade that I lost on was `NVDA` (Bear Call Spead). I should have never entered it in the first place, because the stock has been on a massive uptrend over the past 6 months.

I simply saw that it was overbought, so decided to enter the trade.  I realized later that I shouldn't have, so took my loss early before things got worse.

The other mistake I made was not sticking to my <a href="/rules/#risk-level-trade-sizing/">sizing rules</a>.  

I am still not so confident, so decided to trade just ONE option on both `SPY` and `GOOG` trades.  

Based on my risk and portfolio size, I should have traded 4 options on each.

Let's see if I can do any better next month!
