First losing month in a while (<a href="/tags/monthly-report/">since Sept 2023</a>).

Loss was also a bit bigger than it should've been because I hesitated to cut my losses when I should've.

Always harder to take a loss than you think it would be.  My mind is weak.

Market has been super choppy recently, so not too many closed trades.

## Notes and Thoughts

If I had cut my losses when I should've, I probably would've been close to breakeven on the month.  Still would've lost a little bit (maybe $100-$200).

Or, if I decide to increase my risk tolerance a bit, I probably could've held on to the losers (i.e. `AMD`), and got back to breakeven when the market bounced again.  It's always easy to look back and see what you should've done when it has already happened.

### Bear markets
It seems I'm still not able to make money when the market drops, or goes bearish.  

One problem this time was that I had too many bullish positions open to begin with.  When everything starts dropping, I get caught with my pants down.

So, maybe I need to start taking a few more bearish positions even if the market is trending up just to balance out the odds a bit.  Then, just eat the losses quickly?  Easier said than done I guess.

Something to think about.
