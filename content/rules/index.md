# My Trading Rules

Here are the trading rules I follow.  

Most of these rules are taken from Gin Lim over at passiveseeds.com, so big shout out to him.

I only sell bull put spreads or bear call spreads right now, so these are the rules:

## Bull Put Credit Spread 
### Entry rules
1. Probability of profit (i.e. Probability out of the money) > 75%
2. Implied volatility percentile > 30%; preferably > 50%
3. High liquidity (Open interest > 300)
4. Bid Ask Spread < $1
6. Expiry in 35-60 days
7. No earnings in next 3 weeks
5. Initial profit target (premium / spread-premium) > 15% 
8. Stochastics are oversold (< 20), or RSI is oversold (< 30)
9. Strike is below support
10. Price is in uptrend, or flat/sideways range

### Exit rules
1. Take profit at 50% of initial collected premium 
2. Take loss at 200% of initial collected premium (or 4:1 profit target)
3. Take loss if support is broken (full candle below support)

## Bear Call Credit Spread
Everything the same as Bull Put Spread, except:
- look for OVERBOUGHT stochastics (entry rule #8), 
- sell strike price ABOVE RESISTANCE (#9), 
- look for stock price to be in a possible DOWNTREND or sideways range (entry rule #10),
- take loss if resistance is broken (exit rule #3)

## Risk level + trade sizing
1% risk per trade based on exit plan.  

My current capital is about 30k, so my **max risk per trade is about $300**.

My exit rule is to cut losses at 200% of collected premium, and take profits at 50%.  Since my max risk/loss is $300, **my target for initial premium collected is $150**. 

**Example**
If the premium collected per option sold is $50, then I should sell 3 options (i.e. $150 collected).  
I would take profits when I can buy back the position at $25 per spread (i.e. 50% profit target = $75 profit).  
I would cut my losses when the premium is at $150 (i.e. $450 cost - $150 collected premium = $300 net loss).

## General rules
1. Be disciplined, follow the rules  for entry, exit, and sizing
2. Review positions at end of every trading day to consider early exits.
3. Be patient, no need to trade everyday if there's nothing good
4. Be disciplined (reminder ðŸ¤“)
